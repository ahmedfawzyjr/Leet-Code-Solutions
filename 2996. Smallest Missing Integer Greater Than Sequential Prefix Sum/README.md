# 2996. Smallest Missing Integer Greater Than Sequential Prefix Sum

**Difficulty:** Easy

**Link:** [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-missing-integer-greater-than-sequential-prefix-sum/)

## Problem Description

You are given a **0-indexed** array of integers `nums`.

A prefix `nums[0..i]` is **sequential** if, for all `1 <= j <= i`, `nums[j] == nums[j - 1] + 1`. In particular, the prefix consisting only of `nums[0]` is sequential.

Return the *smallest* integer `x` missing from `nums` such that `x` is greater than or equal to the sum of the *longest* sequential prefix.

### Example 1:

**Input:** `nums = [1,2,3,2,5]`  
**Output:** `6`  
**Explanation:** The longest sequential prefix of `nums` is `[1,2,3]` with a sum of 6. 6 is not in the array, therefore 6 is the smallest missing integer greater than or equal to the sum of the longest sequential prefix.

### Example 2:

**Input:** `nums = [3,4,5,1,12,14,13]`  
**Output:** `15`  
**Explanation:** The longest sequential prefix of `nums` is `[3,4,5]` with a sum of 12. 12, 13, and 14 belong to the array while 15 does not. Therefore 15 is the smallest missing integer greater than or equal to the sum of the longest sequential prefix.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 50`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 50`

## Approach & Complexity

### Approach: Prefix Sum + Hash Set Lookup

1. **Longest Sequential Prefix Sum:**
   - Iterate through `nums` starting from index 1.
   - Accumulate the sum as long as `nums[i] == nums[i - 1] + 1`. Break at the first index where sequential order breaks.
2. **Find Smallest Missing Integer:**
   - Store all numbers of `nums` in a hash set for O(1) lookups.
   - Start checking from `seq_sum`. Increment by 1 while the value exists in the set.
   - Return the first integer not found in the set.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N)$, where $N$ is the length of `nums`.
- **Space Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N)$ to store the array elements in a hash set.
